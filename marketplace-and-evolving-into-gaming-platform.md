# Marketplace and Evolving into Gaming Platform

Being an NFT-based game, the Keepers of the Cryptoverse could rely on a number of existing NFT marketplaces such as OpenSea, SuperRare etc., the team believes that these marketplaces are more suited for trading art-based NFTs than in-game items. Therefore it is in the immediate plans of the team to create an internal marketplace for trading in-game items.&#x20;

Additional benefit of having an internal marketplace is an ability to support batch NFT transfers, which are currently not possible in existing open marketplaces.&#x20;

This being said, the development team acknowledges that if the player would want to trade their game items on external marketplaces supporting ERC-721 and ERC-1155 standards, they are very welcome to do so.&#x20;

From the early days of the Game development the team chose the modular design of the Game smart contracts that hopefully should evolve into an open protocol, making The Keepers of the Cryptoverse not just a game, but a gaming platform. The idea here is over time to empower the community to start contributing to the Game expansion and earn from it via royalties %%. Using Minecraft as an analogy, this could be thought of as user-created mods that guarantee their creators a certain cut of the players-generated game revenue.
