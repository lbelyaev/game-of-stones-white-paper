# Team and Philosophy

Keepers of the Cryptoverse is being developed by a small but very capable team, comprised from people well versed in development of complex scalable products, blockchain and smart contracts, investing, community building.

The team motto is twofold:&#x20;

* Do more with less&#x20;
* Community first&#x20;

What this means is that spending a lot of (investors’) money we invest or all experience, involve the community as early as possible, test, iterate and evolve. Blockchain gaming space is still in its infancy, no-one has got all the answers, and players are learning together with developers.
