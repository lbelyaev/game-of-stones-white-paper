# Fungible and semi-fungible tokens

All NFT-based game items are unique and are characterized by a set of properties, defining the item's relative power and rarity. Power and rarity determine the price which the community ascribes to one item or another.&#x20;

Semi-fungible-based game items (Stone Shards) are completely identical within their kind, and differ only in quantity, i.e. 10 Shards of Energy Stone of one player are totally equal, completely interchangeable and should cost the same price as other 10 Shards of Energy Stone from another player.&#x20;

Price for Stone Shards will be determined by the following factors:&#x20;

* **Kind** (different kinds of Stones have different properties, some of which will be revealed at later stages of the Game),&#x20;
* **Size** (size determines LEQ emission rate from the locked Stone Shard, and dependency on the Shard size is not linear (i.e. bigger Shards have disproportionately higher LEQ emission rate and vice versa)&#x20;

All game items, non- and semi-fungible will be available to trade/exchange between players (and perhaps collectors) via both internal game marketplace and external secondary marketplaces (Opensea, etc.).
