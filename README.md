# Keepers of The Cryptoverse

Keepers of the Cryptoverse is a community-driven play-to-earn (P2E) fantasy blockchain-based Game, loosely based on the ideas of Minecraft and some of the popular fantasy space-themed storylines. It could be described as a collectible / puzzle / crafting game based around its own open economy. Its goal is to bring crypto-native folks and also onboard wide masses of ‘crypto-naïves’ to enjoy the quest, competition and rewards.&#x20;
