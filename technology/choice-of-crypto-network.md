# Choice of Crypto Network

Initial decision taken by the development team was to design an EVM-compatible gaming platform to appeal to the largest gaming community and Web 3 community as a whole. Also, since the goal for the Game is to evolve into a self-sustaining crypto-economy, building bridges with adjacent industries such as DeFi is of paramount importance.&#x20;

Decision to initially launch on Ethereum is also driven by extensive relevant experience of the development team.&#x20;

This being said, the team is constantly and closely monitoring the fast development of the blockchain space, in a constant lookout for possible alternatives, such as L2 networks, EVM-compatible L1 networks, bridges, etc.&#x20;

Any decision that could potentially impact assets owned / earned by users will be taken after careful consideration and in a dialogue with the community.
