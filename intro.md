# Intro

### The Game

Keepers of the Cryptoverse is a community-driven play-to-earn (P2E) fantasy blockchain-based Game, loosely based on the ideas of Minecraft and some of the popular fantasy space-themed storylines. It could be described as a collectible / puzzle / crafting game based around its own open economy. Its goal is to bring crypto-native folks and also onboard wide masses of ‘crypto-naïves’ to enjoy the quest, competition and rewards.&#x20;

Inspiration for the Keepers of the Cryptoverse come from several places:&#x20;

* The Minecraft game, which never gets old, is eternal and limitless, and is being played by millions and millions of fans around the world. Another admirable feature of Minecraft is it’s extensibility through mods / resource packs that could be developed, distributed and used by anyone,&#x20;
* Recent adoption of NTF concept and proliferation of NFT-based games such as Axie Infinity, Gods Unchained, etc.&#x20;
* Concept of the Metaverse (with strong Crypto flavor), where reality and virtual world meet, interact and evolve,&#x20;
* Decentralization of governance, which is still a fairly new concept but gaining steady traction in DAOs, community-owned gaming, etc.&#x20;

The big vision of the team behind the Keepers of the Cryptoverse is to create a Web3 version of open-ended gaming ecosystem which will be co-owned and co-governed together by the community of players, supporters and different development teams, including the original one.&#x20;

We believe that the relatively easy and straightforward gameplay will be an excellent way for crypto-naïves to experience the Cryproverse and get familiar with such concepts as digital ownership, crypto assets, tokenomics (earning, spending, staking) and so much more. At the same time, the game itself will mature and evolve, bringing even more fun to even more players.
