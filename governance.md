# Governance

Launching the Governance Token (see above) will achieve an ultimate goal for the development team to create an equitable and thriving economy around game mechanics.&#x20;

The plan is to create a DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) that will take over the game ownership and will be responsible for taking further decisions on the game roadmap, new items and modules, etc.&#x20;

DAO launch should happen in late 2022 - early 2023, as soon as the governance token is launched and DAO design is complete.
