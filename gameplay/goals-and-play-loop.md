# Goals and Play Loop

Initial players goals therefore are:&#x20;

* To grab one or a few of Genesis items (limited to 10 per an EOA) and wait for reveal,&#x20;
* To look for matching keys, trade / exchange keys with other players to get a matching set,&#x20;
* To compete for mining of Stone Shards and try to get some of those,&#x20;
* Once a Shard is locked inside a Tesseract, to start earn Light Energy Quanta (LEQ)&#x20;
* Depending on Tesseract strength, to recharge it more or less frequently to ensure that LEQ emission continues&#x20;
* (Optionally) to spend available LEQ to upgrade Tesseract, travel to another realm and mine more Stone Shards, purchase some Dark Energy&#x20;
* (Optionally) to use Dark Energy to mint new Tesseracts and Keys

Main game mechanics are driven by:&#x20;

* Scarce nature of the main game items, leading to natural competition between players,&#x20;
* Uncertainty (random distribution of ‘starter packs’ and items in them, randomized mining schedules, etc.),&#x20;
* Time-bound actions, like mining auctions and Tesseract recharging,&#x20;
* Earning incentives and possibility of increasing the earning rate, Ability to create new items by combining existing ones with light or dark powers,&#x20;
* Space travel between realms and further exploration of the Cryptoverse, In the future - taking part in game governance&#x20;

At the time of writing of this Paper, there are no plans for any PvP mechanics; however it could change as the Game evolves. Full spectre of possible actions by players is shown below.
