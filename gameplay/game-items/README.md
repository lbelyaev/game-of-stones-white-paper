# Game Items

Game items include:

* **Stone Shards** (fractions of 5 different Foundational Stones), scattered across the realms of the Cryptoverse (5 realms is known so far),
* **Tesseracts** (containers for storing and activating Shards, which makes them emit Light Energy),
* **Keys** (matching keys unlock Tesseracts before Shards could be stored there),
* **Light Energy** (in-game utility token, used for buying and upgrading things and traveling between realms of the Cryptoverse),
