# Tesseracts

Tesseracts are containers that are used to store Stone Shards and allow them to emit Light Energy Quanta.&#x20;

Initial (Genesis) Tesseracts are distributed within 20,000 of Starter items.&#x20;

Each Tesseract is unique. Tesseracts differ by the following properties:&#x20;

* **Material**. Could be either Copper (basic), Bronze, Silver, Gold or Platinum. Determines material of required Key(s)&#x20;
* **Lock Hash Pattern**. Unique 5-number combination that determines required set of Keys to open a Tesseract&#x20;
* **Size**. Determines the maximum size of a Shard a Tesseract can hold, ranges 1 - 50 Multi-stone capability. Multi-stone Tesseracts can contain Shards of multiple type, which could be useful for alchemy transformations in the future&#x20;
* **Power**. Determines ‘work time’ time of Tesseract from the moment the Stone Shard is locked inside and Light Energy emission begins. The more power grade, the longer the work time. Before work time expires, Tesseract needs to be recharged to restore its ability to generate Light Energy emission. If the work times expires without recharge, the Tesseract becomes unusable and eventually dissolves&#x20;

To place and to extract shards of Stones to/from a Tesseract, Keys are required.
