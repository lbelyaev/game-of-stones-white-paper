# Tesseracts

Tesseracts are containers that are used to store Stone Shards and allow them to emit Light Energy Quanta.&#x20;

Initial (Genesis) Tesseracts are distributed within 20,000 of Starter items.&#x20;

Each Tesseract is unique. Tesseracts differ by the following properties:&#x20;

* **Material**. Could be either Copper (basic), Bronze, Silver, Gold or Platinum. Determines material of required Key(s)&#x20;
* **Lock Hash Pattern**. Unique 5-number combination that determines required set of Keys to unlock a Tesseract&#x20;
* **Size**. Determines the maximum size of a Shard a Tesseract can hold, ranges 1 - 50&#x20;
* **Type / Multi-stone capability**. Multi-stone Tesseracts can contain Stone Shards of multiple type, which could be useful for alchemic transformations in the future&#x20;
* **Power**. Determines ‘work time’ time of Tesseract from the moment the Stone Shard is locked inside and Light Energy emission begins. The more power grade, the longer the work time. Before work time expires, Tesseract needs to be recharged to restore its ability to generate Light Energy emission. If the work times expires without recharge, the Tesseract becomes unusable and eventually dissolves&#x20;

To place and to extract Stone Shards to/from a Tesseract, Keys are required.

Once locked inside a Tesseract, a Stone Shard starts to emit the Light Energy Quanta, which reflects in player's ability to claim the Game utility token - LEQ. Emission capability depends on the following factors:

* Stone Shard type, and
* Stone Shard size

Emission capability grows disproportionally with Shards size, i.e. bigger Shards are more lucrative from player's earning standpoint.

Once LEQ emission starts, it doesn't continue forever, since Tesseracts have a finite 'work time'. LEQ emission therefore decreases linearly to zero over time. Speed of emission decrease is determined by Tesseract's power. Once it drops to zero, the Tesseract becomes unusable.&#x20;

In order for LEQ emission to continue, the Tesseract needs recharging. Rechaging costs LEQ and it restores emission power to 100% and starts the new emission cycle.
