# Tesseracts

![Tesseract](<../../.gitbook/assets/tess\_blue (1).png>)

Tesseracts are containers that are used to store Stone Shards and allow them to emit Light Energy Quanta.&#x20;

Each Tesseract is unique. Tesseracts differ by the following properties:&#x20;

* **Material**. Could be either Copper (basic), Bronze, Silver, Gold or Platinum. Determines material of required Key(s)&#x20;
* **Lock Hash Pattern**. Unique 5-number combination that determines required set of Keys to unlock a Tesseract&#x20;
* **Size**. Determines the maximum size of a Shard a Tesseract can hold, ranges 1 - 50&#x20;
* **Type / Multi-stone capability**. Multi-stone Tesseracts can contain Stone Shards of multiple type, which could be useful for alchemic transformations in the future&#x20;
* **Power**. Determines ‘work time’ time of Tesseract from the moment the Stone Shard is locked inside and Light Energy emission begins. The more power grade, the longer the work time. Before work time expires, Tesseract needs to be recharged to restore its ability to generate Light Energy emission. If the work times expires without recharge, the Tesseract becomes unusable and eventually dissolves&#x20;

### Using Tesseracts

To place and to extract Stone Shards to/from a Tesseract, Keys are required.

Once locked inside a Tesseract, a Stone Shard starts to emit the Light Energy Quanta, which reflects in player's ability to claim the Game utility token - LEQ.&#x20;

Emission capability grows disproportionally with Shards size, i.e. bigger Shards are more lucrative from player's earning standpoint.

Once LEQ emission starts, it doesn't continue forever, since Tesseracts have a finite 'work time'. LEQ emission therefore decreases linearly to zero over time. Speed of emission decrease is determined by Tesseract's power. Once it drops to zero, the Tesseract becomes unusable.&#x20;

In order for LEQ emission to continue, the Tesseract needs recharging. Rechaging costs LEQ and it restores emission power to 100% and starts the new emission cycle.

### Upgrading Tesseracts

Tesseract has a property of size, which determines the maximum size of Stone Shard it can hold. If a player - owner of Tesseract wants it to hold a bigger Stone Shard, they can perform a Tesseract upgrade, increasing its size.&#x20;

Size upgrade is a fixed-price operation requiring payment in LEQ tokens.

Upgrading Tesseract's Power with LEQ is not possible. To have a more powerful Tesseract a player needs to buy or mint a new one (see below).

### Obtaining Tesseracts

Initial Tesseracts are distributed as part of 20,000 of Genesis items during Launch pre-sale. After the Launch pre-sale is complete and the items metadata is revealed, players are able to trade Tesseracts in the open market (Opensea, etc.) and in the Game marketplace.&#x20;

However, initial mint of 10,000 Tesseracts cannot satisfy all potential players. To allow inflow of new Tesseracts into the Game, custom on-demand minting of Tesseracts will be made available in the future Game roadmap. It is planned that Dark Energy items will be required for Tesseract on-demand minting, and unique properties of source Dark Energy items will impact the properties of the target Tesseracts.

### Future types of Tesseracts

Initially available Genesis Tesseracts will be single-stone, which means they are able to hold Stone Shard of only one kind.

In the future, the Game plans to introduce new types of Tesseracts, such as:

* **Collectors' Tesseract** - capable of holding 3 or 5 Stone Shards of different kinds,
* **Alchemy Tesseract** - a multi-stone Tesseract capable of performing alchemic transformations of Stone Shards
