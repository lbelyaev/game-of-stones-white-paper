# Keys

![Key](../../.gitbook/assets/Key.png)



Keys (available initially, also known as Tesseract Keys) are required to lock/unlock Tesseracts.

Each Key is unique; Keys have the following distinguishing properties:&#x20;

* **Lock Pattern**. Unique 5-number combination that should match a lock combination of a target Tesseract (perhaps with the other Keys in a set)&#x20;
* **Material**. Could be either Copper (basic), Bronze, Silver, Gold or Platinum. Should match material of a target Tesseract&#x20;
* **Math props**. It could be a combination of the following properties: Patterns, Primes, Fibonacci. Each available prop could be used as a wild card for matching hash patterns&#x20;
* **Kind**. Initially available Keys are able only to lock/unlock Tesseracts.&#x20;
* **Rarity / Handle**. The use of this property will be revealed further down the Game timeline.&#x20;

### Using Keys&#x20;

In order to lock/unlock a Tesseract, a player needs to collect a number of Keys that match or exceed the pattern of a target Tesseract.

### Obtaining Keys

Genesis Keys are distributed within 20,000 Genesis items, along with the Tesseracts and Stone Shards. After the Launch pre-sale is complete and the items metadata is revealed, players are able to trade Keys in the open market (Opensea, etc.) and in the Game marketplace.&#x20;

However, initial mint of \~10,000 Keys cannot satisfy all potential players. To allow inflow of new Keys into the Game, custom on-demand minting of Keys will be made available in the future Game roadmap. It is planned that Dark Energy items will be required for Keys on-demand minting, and unique properties of source Dark Energy items will impact the properties of the target Keys.

### Future Key Types

In the future the Game plans to introduce other types of Keys, such as:

* **Anywhere (or Travel) Key** (allowing instant travel),&#x20;
* **Power Key** (increases power or work time of Tesseract),
* **Alchemy Key** (required for Alchemy Tesseracts to do magic)
