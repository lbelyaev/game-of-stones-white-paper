# Keys

Initial (Genesis) Keys are distributed within 20,000 Starter items, along with the Tesseracts.&#x20;

Each Key is unique; Keys have the following distinguishing power:&#x20;

* **Lock Pattern**. Unique 5-number combination that should match a lock combination of a target Tesseract (perhaps with the other Keys in a set)&#x20;
* **Material**. Could be either Copper (basic), Bronze, Silver, Gold or Platinum. Should match material of a target Tesseract&#x20;
* **Math props**. It could be a combination of the following properties: Patterns, Primes, Fibonacci. Each available prop could be used as a wild card for matching hash patterns&#x20;
* **Kind**. Initially available Keys are able only to lock/unlock Tesseracts.&#x20;
* **Rarity / Handle**. The use of this property will be revealed further down the Game timeline.&#x20;

In order to lock/unlock a Tesseract, Keeper needs to collect a number of keys that match or exceed the pattern of a target Tesseract.
