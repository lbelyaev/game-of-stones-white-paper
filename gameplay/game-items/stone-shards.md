# Stone Shards

Stones represent 5 foundational elements of the Cryptoverse:&#x20;

This stone is in charge of the circulation of energy in the Cryptoverse. It can also (under certain circumstances) open portals and wormholes&#x20;

This stone is in charge of creation and transformation of all kinds of matter. Different forms of matter could be combined together and with the help of Dark Energy can create new types&#x20;

Stone Shards differ in their importance and hence the rarity. Energy, Matter and Time Stone Shards are the most ubiquitous. Life and Mind Stones are far more rare and therefore more precious. Stone Shards are scattered across the Cryptoverse and could be freely mined (or later acquired/traded).&#x20;

Multiple Shards of the same kind could be melted together to create more powerful Stone Shards. Since the Shards represent fractions of the whole original foundational Stones, their supply is naturally scarce.&#x20;

Playersâ€™ ability to mine new Stone Shards will be gradually decreasing over time, as more and more Shards become mined.

&#x20;A Shard, being placed inside a Tesseract, gets the ability to emit Light Energy Quanta (LEQ), the in-game utility token.
