# Summary

Keepers of the Cryptoverse could be characterized as an open-ended competitive puzzle/collectibles game.&#x20;

Players are incentivized to compete with each other to mine and collect scarce game elements around the realms of the Cryptoverse in the quest to restore the original order that was disrupted a while ago by a catastrophic event of epic proportions.&#x20;

Game items include:

* **Stone Shards** (fractions of 5 different Foundational Stones), scattered across the realms of the Cryptoverse (5 realms is known so far),
* **Tesseracts** (containers for storing and activating Shards, which makes them emit Light Energy),
* **Keys** (matching keys unlock Tesseracts before Shards could be stored there),
* **Light Energy** (in-game utility token, used for buying and upgrading things and traveling between realms of the Cryptoverse),
