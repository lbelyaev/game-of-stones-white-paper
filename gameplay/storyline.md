# Storyline

Keepers of the Cryptoverse could be characterized as an open-ended competitive puzzle / collectibles / crafting P2E (play-to-earn) game.&#x20;

Players are incentivized to compete with each other to mine, collect and/or craft scarce game elements in order to restore original Cryptoverse order that was disrupted a while ago by an epic catastrophic event.

As the story goes, In the beginning of the Cryptoverse, there were the Stones. They were foundational elements that created and kept the Cryptoverse together for ages. The Cryptoverse was filled with energy - Light Energy and Dark Energy, which co-existed and helped to keep peace and prosperity.&#x20;

Many years ago there happened an accidental collision of the two energies - Light and Dark, which resulted in the Epic Blast. Epic Blast blew the Stones into small bits - Shards - and scattered them across all the worlds. Also, as a result of the Epic Blast the Light Energy has disappeared.&#x20;

The Council of the Cryptoverse founded the Order of Keepers of the Cryptoverse - with a mission to find and collect the Shards, and - eventually - assemble the Stones back and bring Light Energy back into the Cryptoverse, restoring the original balance and prosperity.&#x20;

It was found that Stone Shards can start to emit Light Energy once placed and locked in a special container - Tesseract.&#x20;

In order for the Keepers to succeed on their mission, the Council pre-forged 20,000 of Genesis Tesseracts and Keys that are available to anyone who wants to join the Order.
