# Game Launch

The game starts after 20,000 Genesis game items are randomly generated and then distributed among players during Launch Presale on a come-first-get-first basis. A Genesis item could be either:

* a Tesseract,
* a Tesseract Key, or
* a Stone Shard of a random type and size

The team will follow best practices for fair NFT generation and distribution. Our approaches to random generation and fair distribution is detailed further on in [randomness-considerations-for-initial-distribution](../technology/randomness-considerations-for-initial-distribution/ "mention")section of this White Paper.

Genesis NFT items will be offered in packs:&#x20;

* 1 item&#x20;
* 5 items&#x20;
* 10 items&#x20;

During Launch Presale all Genesis items will have the same generic metadata featuring Game logo and name.

Launch Presale will limit 10 Genesis items per unique account (Ethereum EOA). Once all Genesis NFTs are sold, metadata reveal will follow in \~5 days.&#x20;

Upon metadata reveal, all items and their properties shall be fully visible on Opensea and one the Game website, and the trading of items can begin immediately thereafter.

The Game website/web app and the gameplay will launch at the same time as the metadata for pre-sold items is revealed.
